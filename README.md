Algorithm Performance Analysis Project

A comprehensive C++ project implementing and analyzing the performance of fundamental algorithms: Sorting, Searching, and Dynamic Programming (DP).
 Overview
The goal of this project is to solve algorithmic problems using different approaches and measure their efficiency across varying input sizes. It specifically measures the runtime in microseconds and nanoseconds to observe theoretical time complexities in practice.
Algorithms Implemented
1. Merge Sort (Sorting)
Approach: Divide and Conquer.
Complexity: O(nlog⁡n)O(nlogn)
 (Best, Average, and Worst case).
Purpose: Efficiently sorts large datasets by recursively splitting and merging arrays.
2. Binary Search (Searching)
Approach: Decrease and Conquer.
Complexity: O(log⁡n)O(logn).
Purpose: Extremely fast searching in a sorted array by halving the search space at each step.
3. 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
Approach: Bottom-Up Tabulation.
Complexity: O(n⋅W)
O(n⋅W).
